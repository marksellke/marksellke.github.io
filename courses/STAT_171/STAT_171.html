                Stochastic processes are probabilistic models that describe how systems evolve randomly over time. They are fundamental tools for understanding stock market fluctuations, gene expression, climate modeling and more. This course develops the theoretical foundations of stochastic processes. We will explore how randomness and time interact in complex systems, building up from finite Markov chains to sophisticated continuous-time processes like Brownian motion.

            <h2>Course Materials</h2>
            <p>The textbook for this course is <a href="https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9781118740712">Introduction to Stochastic Processes with R</a> by Robert P. Dobrow. Students can download it for free from the Harvard Library.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>Homework (25%), Midterm (20% x2), Final (35%). </p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
         <h2>Problem Set Policies</h2> There will be a total of ten problem sets. Solutions will be due on Fridays at 11:59 PM and must be submitted through Gradescope as a single PDF file. Submissions on paper or through email will not be accepted.
        Solutions may be typeset or handwritten and scanned but must be clear, legible, and correctly oriented. Otherwise, the assignment will receive no credit. If multiple files are submitted, only the final pdf submitted prior to the deadline will
        be graded. Each problem set will contain a few computational problems in addition to theoretical calculations. Use of R
        is encouraged for these problems, but it is not required. Collaboration with other students is encouraged, but students
        must write their own solutions in their own words. In addition, students must acknowledge their collaborators on the
        submitted assignments. The two lowest homework scores will be dropped. To account for unexpected circumstances,
        every student will be given two extensions, in which homework may be submitted by Saturday 5:00 PM (EST), the day
        after the normal Friday due date. You do not need to send an email to use this extension.
        </div>

<div class="section">
        <h2>Submitting Problem Sets</h2>
            Problem sets should be submitted through Gradescope, as a PDF file. 
            The PDF may be typed (e.g. in Latex), or neatly hand-written and scanned (please check for legibility in this case).
            <b>Make sure to select which pages correspond to which problems, to ensure all of your solutions are graded</b>.
            See this helpful short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nksyA0s-Geo">video</a> for clarification.
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Midterm Exams</h2> 
There will be two in-class midterms, on March 4 and April 8. Notes are not permitted, and make-up exams will not be given. 
Students with an <b>excused</b> absence will have their score on the final exam used as replacement. 
Students with an <b>unexcused</b> absence will receive zero for a missed exam.
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Scribing Notes</h2> 
Students may sign-up to scribe lecture notes for 1 homework problem of extra credit. Each day should have at most 2 scribes, and each student can sign-up to scribe at most 1 time. 
Scribes should email their notes to msellke@fas.harvard.edu by noon the day after the lecture.
If you use Latex (which is preferred), please send both the pdf and source files. 
If you hand-write, we may ask you to rewrite your notes if they are illegible or contain mistakes. 
Notes will be uploaded to Canvas 1-2 days after lecture, and students enrolled in the course can access them <a href="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/145623/files/folder/Scribe%20Notes">here</a>.
